# Assesment3
COT-Assesment-3-Moksha&amp;Divya

Our intention behind creating this app is to help people who struggle with excercise, self care and dieting (Though the diet section will not be built completely). We have used Figma to implement out ideas and create and UI and UX design. For this project, we will code the app so that it can be used outside Figma with more fucntionality. We will use html for the structure of the webapp, CSS to style it, and JavaScript for its functionality. We will also use Object Oriented Programming (OOP) to organise and structure code using classes. 
# The app's functions/purposes:
  - Provides timers for excercice for users to track
  - Reccomends excercises/ activities to users in case they do not know where to start
  - Provides links to lifelines
And a lot more too.
